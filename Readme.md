Tagline: Quick Commerce on Blockchain‚Ä®Chain: Custom Arbitrum Orbit with Avail DA‚Ä®Infrastructure: Powered by QuickNode
üìù Problem We're Solving
In traditional e-commerce platforms, transparency and trust are limited by centralized operations, data control, and high transaction costs. QCom solves these issues by providing a fully decentralized, blockchain-powered e-commerce platform that ensures secure, verifiable, and cost-effective transactions. With QCom, customers can enjoy a transparent shopping experience with real-time transaction monitoring, while merchants benefit from lower transaction costs and efficient data accessibility for analytics.
‚öôÔ∏è Tools and Technologies Used
* Custom Arbitrum Orbit Chain: The backbone of QCom, providing high scalability and customized, application-specific features tailored for e-commerce.
* Avail DA: Serves as the data availability layer, ensuring efficient, tamper-resistant access to transaction data while maintaining scalability.
* QuickNode: Integral to the platform, powering key elements:
    * RPC endpoint: Facilitates quick, reliable interaction between QCom and Avail.
    * IPFS: Secures product image storage, offering decentralized accessibility.
    * QuickAlerts: Monitors the VectorX contract for order transactions, triggering serverless functions for real-time data validation.
    * Serverless Functions: Automate data verification for unmatched transactions in our SQL database, leveraging Avail‚Äôs Turing Bridge.
üöÄ How These Tools Helped
* QuickNode's Infrastructure: QuickNode provided robust, easy-to-integrate services that made it simple to set up and maintain real-time monitoring and secure data storage. QuickAlerts and IPFS helped us automate transaction verification and ensure decentralized access to product information.
* Avail DA for Data Security and Scalability: By separating data availability from computation, Avail DA made it possible for QCom to handle high transaction loads without compromising on security or speed, essential for a smooth e-commerce experience.
* Customizable L3 Chain: Using an L3 chain allowed us to tailor specific e-commerce features such as fee management, governance, and transaction prioritization, creating an optimized platform.
üîç Unique Solution and Impact
QCom introduces a unique verification process to enhance transaction security:
1. Transaction Hash Storage: Each order‚Äôs block hash is stored in an SQL database.
2. QuickAlert Monitoring: QuickNode‚Äôs QuickAlerts track order transactions in the VectorX contract.
3. Automated Verification via QuickNode Functions: Detected transactions trigger a serverless function, which retrieves unverified hashes from SQL and verifies them through the Avail Turing Bridge.
This verification flow ensures transparent, secure order processing while maintaining a high-performance user experience. QCom combines the power of Avail DA and QuickNode infrastructure to make blockchain-based e-commerce secure, scalable, and cost-effective. This approach is a game-changer, addressing trust issues in online shopping and enhancing transparency for both buyers and sellers.
üåü Why QCom Matters
QCom‚Äôs decentralized e-commerce platform provides a new level of transparency, security, and efficiency. This not only empowers users with a trustworthy shopping experience but also demonstrates a practical use case for blockchain technology in e-commerce.
